# YankIt #

This is the source code for YankIt, a command-line program that unpacks files
from ShrinkIt archives.  It was written for the Apple IIgs in 1992.  The
code was written for the Orca/M assembler.

The features and usage are described in the original [readme](readme).

The program has a bug that will cause it to fail on some compressed data.
This is noted in the code (see shk.asm) but I never got around to fixing it.

A ShrinkIt archive is included here that has the original source code and
an executable binary.
